To submit pull requests for truffle, you need to sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][1].
There is a white-list for contributors who have signed the OCA so please add a comment
to your first pull request indicating the name you used to sign the OCA if it isn't clear
from your github profile.

Pull requests can only be merged by committers and a committer cannot merge
his or her own pull requests.

When creating a pull request, make sure you designate an assignee to ensure
the request is processed in a timely manner.
